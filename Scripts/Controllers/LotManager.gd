Notes to do this script:
	1: This code are going to manage buildings since they need to be created 'til they're finished.
	2: I need to save into a JSON object every house_type and every resource needed to create to quickly get here.
	3.1: I need to have a son ui node showing and able to select the materials and send to him to complete the house
	3.2: And after the 3.1, have to destroy this son (if the house is completed!!!)
